Resume Screening and Candidate Ranking System

This project was developed as part of my online internship to streamline the hiring process using automation and intelligent ranking.

With this tool, recruiters can simply input a job description and upload candidate resumes directly through the interface. The system then analyzes each resume to the provided job requirements, assigns a relevance score, and ranks them accordingly.

By automating the screening process, this project helps employers quickly identify the most suitable candidates, saving both time and effort while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation.
